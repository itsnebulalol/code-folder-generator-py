# Code Folder Generator
The most simple project folder generator written in Python.

## Install
1. (OPTIONAL) Rename `main.py` to something easier. (e.g. `gen.py`)
2. Move the file to a directory you will remember.
3. Setup a path variable to the file.

## Usage
Use `main.py` (or any other name) to run the program in your current working directory.
Enter a project name, and it will make a folder and generate a Git project.
